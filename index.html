        <h3>3D Modelling</h3>
        <p>My journey into the world of 3D modeling began as a college hobby, ignited by my initial exploration of AutoDesk software. It all started with a simple idea â€“ creating a house in 3D. As I delved into the intricacies of 3D design, I realized the immense potential it held. The ability to bring my ideas to life in three dimensions was incredibly inspiring.
